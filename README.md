# Mastermind

Just playing with Scala (first time).

TODO:
1. Refactor unit tests (too many copy-paste there).
2. Make checkGuess fancier (with fold maybe).
3. Better code coverage (the logic and IO aren't covered now)

Update after 5 years:
1. Forget about the things above (no time). DONE, totally forgotten
2. Bump to Scala 3, add Scalafmt and native image as an exercise. DONE
